# Feature_Engineering_of_Audio_Signals
This is a POC to analyze and engineer Audio Signals to extract characteristic features that could be used be to classify the audio signals as well as used to detect the emotional intensity of the signals.

3 separate notebooks are there in this POC that serve the functions as mentioned below:
* The Audio_Data_Analysis notebook contains the EDA part and extracts the various characteristic features from the audio signals.
* The Audio_Data_Classification notebook tries to use the extracted features to perform two separate clustering approaches and form representative clusters.
* The Audio_Emotion_Detection notebook follows supervised learning approach and creates multiple classification models using the extracted signal features.
